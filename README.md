# 2D Terminal Renderer

A simple project that I wrote using C++. The main objective was to learn about the basics of animation rendering on the terminal. This will be expanded in the future for 3D cases.

The app allows various adjustable parameters, including:

- frame width
- frame height
- initial object position
- initial object velocity
- refresh rate
- gravity

You can even adjust the object by editing the object.txt file. I prefer ASCII art, which you can get from many free websites.

It can, of course, support multiple object rendering on the screen, but only boundary collision is implemented at the moment. So object-to-object interaction is lacking. Various parameters can be tuned to make the animation flow more naturally.
